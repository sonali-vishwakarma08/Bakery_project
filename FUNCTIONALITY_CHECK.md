## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES FOUND (Non-Breaking)

### 1. **Hardcoded URLs in Some Pages**
**Impact:** Low - Pages still work, but not using best practices

**Affected Files:**
- `Products.jsx` - Line 19
- `Payment.jsx` - Line 38
- `DeliveryStaff.jsx` - Line 38
- `Reports.jsx` - Lines 26-29
- `AdminProfilePage.jsx` - Lines 36, 80

**Recommendation:** Refactor to use API wrappers (already exist!)

**Current Status:** Pages work fine, but should be refactored for consistency

### 2. **Image URLs Hardcoded**
**Impact:** Low - Images display correctly

**Affected Files:**
- `Banner.jsx`, `Category.jsx`, `SubCategory.jsx`, `Products.jsx`, `Customers.jsx`, `AdminProfilePage.jsx`

**Fix Created:** `utils/imageHelper.js` utility created

**Recommendation:** Update components to use image helper
